# Clan-Manager

## Overview
This application helps manage clans in clans in clash by displaying statistics of individual clan members and their respective contributions to the clan.

I decided to create this project because it would personally help me identify any "slackers" in my clan and is a fun way to learn api's, rest api's and fullstack development.

## Features
- Search up clans by clan tags
- Organize members by their contribution 
- Choose what type of contribution to use (ex. donations, clan war performance, cwl performance, clan capital performance)
- record history of contributions
