# Clan Manager

## Overview
This application helps manage clans in clans in clash by displaying statistics of individual clan members and their respective contributions to the clan.

I decided to create this project because it would personally help me identify any "slackers" in my clan and is a fun way to learn api's, rest api's and fullstack development.

## Features
- Search up clans by clan tags
- Organize members by their contribution 
- Choose what type of contribution to use (ex. donations, clan war performance, cwl performance, clan capital performance)
- record history of contributions
- View how active opponent can is in clan wars
- Compare statistics between clans

## Proccess
- began by trying to learn what a rest api actually is -> did so through youtube videos (main one that worked for me linked below)
- watched/skimmed through a 12 hour python course by bro code (very good video) 
- Started backend, looked through a bunch of tutorials until I came across the Flask Mega-Tutorial which significantly helped me set everything up - Got a bit stuck on the databases in which I used SLQAlchemy documentation a bit and some videos to explain migration (linked below)
